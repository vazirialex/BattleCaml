# BattleCaml
CS3110 Final Project: the greatest OCaml port of battleship. It's battleship with camels.

You must have the curses and ANSITerminal library installed to run. Use `opam install curses` and `opam install ansiterminal` to install them.
Then, run `make play` to launch the game.

You can move around using the "WASD" keys, place ships (5) using "p" and "f" to fire (once you have placed your ships). 

Have fun!
